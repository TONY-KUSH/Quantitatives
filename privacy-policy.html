                <h2>RIGHTS FOR INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA</h2>
                <p>Individuals who are residents of California have certain consumer rights under applicable California privacy laws but which may be subject to certain limitations and/or restrictions. Specifically, under California law you may have the right to:</p>
                <ul class="marked-list-policy">
                    <li>Request that we disclose information about the personal information collected, used, disclosed or sold;</li>
                    <li>Request that we delete personal information collected or maintained by us;</li>
                    <li>Opt out of the sale of your personal information; and</li>
                    <li>Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your privacy rights.</li>
                    <li>Please note that we do not, and will not, sell your Personal Information.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A consumer may use an authorized agent to submit a request on the consumer’s behalf. When using an authorized agent, we require that you provide the authorized agent written permission to do so and verify their own identity and agent status with us. If you would like to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, please email us at CCPA@quantitatives.com.</p>
                <p>If you require this notice in an alternative accessible format, please email us at CCPA@quantitatives.com.</p>
                <p>We have instituted a process for verifying that the person making a request to know or a request for deletion is the consumer about whom we have collected information. Whenever feasible, we will match at least two data points in the identifying information provided by the consumer to the Personal Information already maintained by us, but it may require more data points depending on the information requested. We will avoid collecting highly sensitive pieces of personal information, unless necessary.</p>
                <p>In verifying your identity, we will consider the following factors:</p>
                <ol class="list-policy">
                    <li>The type, sensitivity, and value of the personal information collected and maintained about the consumer. Sensitive or valuable personal information shall warrant a more stringent verification process.  The types of personal information identified in Civil Code section 1798.81.5(d) shall be considered presumptively sensitive;</li>
                    <li>The risk of harm to the consumer posed by any unauthorized access or deletion. A greater risk of harm to the consumer by unauthorized access or deletion shall warrant a more stringent verification process;</li>
                    <li>The likelihood that fraudulent or malicious actors would seek the personal information. The higher the likelihood, the more stringent the verification process will be;</li>
                    <li>Whether the personal information to be provided by the consumer to verify their identity is sufficiently robust to protect against fraudulent requests or being spoofed or fabricated;</li>
                    <li>The manner in which the business interacts with the consumer; and</li>
                    <li>Available technology for verification.</li>
                    <li>If we cannot verify your identity in accordance with California law, we may deny your request in whole or in part.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="policy-italic">For online requests to delete, we will use a two-step process where the consumer must first, clearly submit the request to delete and then second, separately confirm that they want their personal information deleted.</p>
                <p>For requests to know and requests to delete, we will confirm receipt of the request within ten (10) days and provide information about how the business will process the request, and we will respond within 45 days with an option to extend an additional 45 days provided we give you notice.</p>
                <p>If you wish to exercise any of your rights under this section, you may submit your request through any of these methods: (i) email us at CCPA@quantitatives.com; (ii) contact us at the toll-free telephone number 1-844-820-6577; or (iii) submit a webform request here.</p>

                <p>We use the reCAPTCHA service provided by Google Inc. (Google) to protect your submissions via internet submission forms on this site. This plugin checks if you are a person in order to prevent certain website functions from being (ab)used by spam bots (particularly comments).

On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of this service. The IP address provided by reCaptcha from your browser shall not be merged with any other data from Google.</p>
