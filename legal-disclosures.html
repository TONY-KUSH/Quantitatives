                <h2 class="numbered-title">3. No Offer of Securities;  No Advice</h2>
                <p class="policy-italic">THIS SITE AND THE INFORMATION INCLUDED HEREIN ARE FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD ANY MATERIAL AT THE SITE BE USED OR CONSIDERED AS AN OFFER TO SELL OR A SOLICITATION OF AN OFFER TO BUY ANY SECURITY, FUTURE OR OTHER FINANCIAL PRODUCT OR INSTRUMENT, INCLUDING ANY INTEREST IN ANY INVESTMENT FUND SPONSORED OR MANAGED BY QUANTITATIVES OR ANY INVESTMENT ADVISORY SERVICES OFFERED BY QUANTITATIVES. ANY SUCH OFFER OR SOLICITATION CAN AND WILL BE MADE ONLY BY MEANS OF THE APPLICABLE CONFIDENTIAL OFFERING MEMORANDUM OF EACH SUCH INVESTMENT FUND OR OTHER APPLICABLE DOCUMENT, ONLY IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH SUCH AN OFFER WOULD BE LAWFUL AND ONLY TO INVESTORS WHO MEET THE INVESTOR SUITABILITY AND SOPHISTICATION REQUIREMENTS OF EACH SUCH INVESTMENT FUND AS DETERMINED FROM TIME TO TIME BY QUANTITATIVES IN ITS SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION.</p>
                <p>Such requirements may include, among other things, qualifying as an “accredited investor” within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended; a “qualified client” within the meaning of the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended; a “qualified eligible person” within the meaning of the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act, as amended; and/or a “qualified purchaser” within the meaning of the rules promulgated under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Access to information about the investment funds managed by, or advisory services offered by, Two Sigma is similarly limited to investors who meet the applicable investor suitability, experience and sophistication requirements.

                <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL QUANTITATIVES OR ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, MEMBERS, PRINCIPALS, INVESTORS, CLIENTS, AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, LOSSES, COSTS OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, LOST PROFITS OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH (I) THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS AND/OR USE THE SITE OR WITH ANY DELAY IN USING THE SITE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF REVENUE, TRADING, PROFITS, ANTICIPATED PROFITS, BUSINESS, SAVINGS, GOODWILL, USE, OPPORTUNITY OR DATA; (II) TWO SIGMA CONTENT, USER CONTENT, OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION AND MATERIALS CONTAINED ON OR OBTAINED THROUGH THE SITE; OR (III) OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF THE ACCESS TO AND/OR USE OF THE SITE; NOR SHALL QUANTITATIVES OR ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, MEMBERS, PRINCIPALS, INVESTORS, CLIENTS, AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER THAT RESULT FROM MISTAKES, OMISSIONS, INTERRUPTIONS, DELETION OF FILES, ERRORS, DEFECTS, DELAYS IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, OR ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED BY EVENTS BEYOND TWO SIGMA’S REASONABLE CONTROL, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ACTS OF GOD, COMMUNICATIONS LINE FAILURE, THEFT, DESTRUCTION, OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO THIS SITE’S RECORDS, PROGRAMS, OR SERVICES.
