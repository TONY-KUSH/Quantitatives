                                        <li>Environmental changes throughout the remainder of the 21st century will undoubtedly influence economic trends. To assess the top-down impact of climate change for strategic asset allocation, we consider both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios.</li>
                                        <li>Our analysis suggests that growth-oriented assets, such as equities, would be directly impacted by climate change. This impact is likely to vary significantly across countries, with the most sizable impact expected in certain emerging markets. </li>

                                <h2 class="brief-title" id="brief-introduction">Introduction</h2>
                                <p>The macroeconomic implications of the physical risks of climate change are expected to lead to adverse growth outcomes for investors. In our analysis, we find that certain asset classes and countries are more vulnerable than others. Countries that face more material environmental challenges face higher physical risks of climate change. The costs of dealing with these risks will be borne by local economies and societies. It is generally accepted that the Energy, Utilities, Materials and Industrials sectors will feel the greatest impact. Demand-side shocks could be related to mortality or growth impacts of climate change, particularly over the longer term. Such shocks are not always easy for central banks to disentangle from the business cycle, which can make them more difficult to respond to</p>
                                <h2 class="brief-title">Study Design</h2>
                                <p>To gauge the impact climate change will have on widely-held asset classes, we incorporate the impacts of both optimistic and pessimistic climate change scenarios into Quantitatives long-term Capital Market Assumptions (CMAs). Since our CMAs have a 10-year horizon and the impacts of climate change are expected to be much longer, we supplement our current process with steady-state estimates for asset class returns to produce long-term assumptions.</p>
                                <h2 class="brief-title">Equity</h2>
                                <p>Our models predict both slowing earnings growth and weaker equity returns in both the US and Japan in the pessimistic climate scenario. However, European equity returns are expected to be modestly positive. Compared to developed markets, the impact of climate change on emerging markets equity returns has larger cross-sectional variation. With already elevated temperatures, future global warming in India is forecast to have a significant negative impact on equity returns over the long term. Brazil and South Africa are also expected to be negatively impacted. China and Taiwan may experience more modest drags, while the effect in Korea is mixed. Aggregating the impact across all emerging market countries by market capitalization reveals a net negative impact.</p>
                                <h2 class="brief-title">GLOBAL Assets</h2>
                                <p>Mitigation responses to climate change are likely to affect individual commodities in different ways at the micro level. For example, certain industrial metals that are used in green energy production will likely command higher prices, while fossil fuel prices will likely suffer from low demand alongside wider use of electric cars. Individual Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) may face varying levels of physical risk from climate change based on their location. There is no impact on (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) TIPS in our pessimistic climate change scenario</p>

                                <h2 class="brief-title">Conclusion</h2>
                                <p>From the perspective of a long-term investor, climate change is a source of considerable uncertainty. The transition to a sustainable economy in various climate change scenarios poses significant physical risks for investors’ portfolios. Transition risks, which include the financial impact of changes to regulation and policies as a result of climate change, will be discussed in a future publication. <br> <br>

                                    Our top-down cross-asset analysis suggests that the most direct impact will be on growth-oriented assets, such as equities and corporate credit. We find that the impact on developed sovereign bonds, REITs and commodities is likely to be more localized at the micro level of individual securities, rather than at the asset-class level. A climate risk-aware portfolio should tilt away from regions and assets that are expected to be adversely affected for better risk-adjusted returns. <br> <br>
                                   
                                   Additionally, we believe that such macroeconomic views should be combined with specific microeconomic and firm-level implications, to more fully measure the impact of climate change within a sufficiently broad framework.</p>
